# **Overview**

Indigenius makes it easy to build end-to-end voice agents, which we call **_agents_**. Agents support live, two way conversations. You can call an assistant or have it call you.

**Each agent has three components**: Speech-to-text (STT), Language Model (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). Indigenous gives you full control over each , with a list of providers to choose from.

**In this quick start, you’ll learn to:**

- Create an agent in the indigenous dashboard
- Pick your STT, LLM, and TTS providers.
- Attach a phone number
- Make your first call over the web or by phone
