# Introduction to Indigenius Agent Pro

The developer platform for building voice AI agents.

Indigenius Agent Pro enables you to **build, test, and deploy real-time voice agents** with ease.

It abstracts away the complexity of underlying infrastructure, making it simple and scalable to create **intelligent, production-ready agents**.

## Key Capabilities

- **Conversational flow**: Turn-taking, interruptions, and backchanneling
- **Low latency**: ~0.75s between turns
- **Programmable logic**: Tool calls, workflows, widgets, and APIs
- **Telephony and streaming**: SIP and web calls
- **Observability**: Transcripts, call reports, metadata, and logs

## What is a Voice Agent?

We call them **Agents**, and they are composed of 3 parts:

1. **Conversation Layer** – Handles natural interactions, turn-taking, and flow.
2. **Logic Layer** – Connects to tools, APIs, and workflows.
3. **Integration Layer** – Interfaces with telephony, streaming, and other platforms.
